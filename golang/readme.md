# Greeter component in Go

This directory contains a greeter component in Go. For this demo, it was compiled to a WebAssembly component using the wasmCloud Shell (`wash`) CLI tool.

The component is already built in the `/build` subdirectory, but if you would like to compile yourself, you can [install `wash`](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/installation) and run:

`wash build`
