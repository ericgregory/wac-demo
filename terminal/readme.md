# Terminal component in Rust

This directory contains a component in Rust that creates an empty string to end the sequence in the composition. For this demo, the Rust code was compiled to a WebAssembly component using `cargo component`.

The component is already built in this directory, but if you would like to compile yourself, you can [install `cargo component`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-component) and run:

```shell
cargo component build
```
